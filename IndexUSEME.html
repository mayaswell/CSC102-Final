<p>
    Money does not create oxygen! No matter how much cash resides in your pockets, bank account, or trust fund,
    it won't keep your pantry stocked if there isn't anything on the shelves in a grocery store. Growing
    a small amount of your own food can lower your monthly spending, provide additional nutrition you might be
    lacking, and allows for a sense of security in uncertain times. A lot of plants only require a small amount
    of space and can be grown anywhere, even indoors! Something as simple as growing a basil plant in your
    windowsill is the first step in sustaining yourself and your household.
    Here are some basic staples that can be
    grown by beginners and green thumbs alike.
